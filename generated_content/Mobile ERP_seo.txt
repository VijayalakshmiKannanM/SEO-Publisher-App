According to a market analysis by Allied Market Research, the global mobile ERP market is predicted to reach an impressive $2.3 billion by 2025, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3% from 2018 to 2025. The widespread adoption of mobile devices and the relentless pursuit of operational excellence contribute significantly to this growth.

With mobile ERP, employees can access essential business functionalities while on the move. This capability is particularly beneficial for sales teams, allowing them to update customer information, verify inventory, and process transactions directly from their smartphones or tablets, therefore boosting productivity substantially.
